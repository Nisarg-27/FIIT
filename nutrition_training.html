            <h1>EAT TO THRIVE</h1>
            <h4>My nutrition coaching philosophy is a simple one: I don’t believe any foods are ‘good’ or ‘bad’, and I know it is possible to reach your goals without suffering through another exhausting crash diet or detox tea cleanse.</h4>   
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="midtext">
            <p>And let’s face it - none of those strategies give you the fuel you need to take on your dreams, anyway. Instead, one-on-one nutrition coaching gives you a toolbox full of knowledge, skills and habits to tackle your goals head-on. With a plan designed specifically for you, you’ll get the accountability, direction and support to help you eat, move and live better.</p>

        <div class="boxes">

       <div> <h3>Boost</h3><p>Boost is here to bridge the gap if you have a good sense of what you need but could use some accountability and help to remove the guesswork and step up your progress. </p>

       <div><h3>Nourish</h3><p>Nourish is for you if you’re tired of short-term crash diets and looking for a sustainable approach to eating healthy, balancing your weight and feeling well-fueled for life.</p>

    <div class="boxes">
        <div><img src="img/first_step.png" style="background-color: black;"> <h3>LET'S GO</h3><p>First, we'll do an assessment that accounts for every aspect of your health, performance and nutrition goals. We’ll discuss your food preferences and patterns, lifestyle needs and the challenges you’ve faced creating the life you want. All of this information feeds into your plan - no templates used here!</p></div> 

        <div><img src="img/step2.PNG"><h3>YOUR PLAN</h3><p>Based on that information, we'll create your individual nutrition strategy. This is not a strict meal plan, but a set of personalized targets that lead you to your goal. We'll break down the habits that stand in your way and build up new ones to make meeting your daily targets second-nature.</p></div>
        <div><img src="img/step3.PNG"><h3>CHECK IN</h3><p>We’ll check in at regular intervals to see how you’re feeling, review your goals and talk through any physical, mental and/or lifestyle factors impacting your journey. From there, expect feedback, support and accountability to nail down what is working and optimize it as we go.</p></div>
        <div><img src="img/step4.PNG"><h3>ONGOING SUPPORT</h3><p>While appointments provide you with valuable time to check-in and build momentum, your coach is always available within 24 hours to answer a burning question or give advice when hiccups arise. With communication methods tailored to what works for you, count on motivation all the way.</p></div>
