            <h4>"Don’t move the way fear makes you move. Move the way love makes you move.
                Move the way joy makes you move."</h4>

        <div class="midtext">
            <p>At its core, exercise should bring you joy, so I like to think of every training session as an opportunity to celebrate what we're capable of. No more ‘have tos’ or ‘I’d really rather nots’, I'm on a mission to develop individualized fitness plans to bring that joy back for you while we rock and roll toward your goals.</p>

       <div><img src="img/first_step.png" style="background-color: black;"> <h3>INTAKE & ASSESSMENT</h3><p>Maybe you're looking to strengthen an old injury or think you'd thrive best in a program delivered outside of a traditional gym. Depending on your unique goals, we’ll go through a set of assessments designed with you in mind. These help me develop the best one-of-a-kind program for you and establish a baseline to celebrate your progress down the road.</p></div> 
       <div><img src="img/step2.PNG"><h3>TRAIN!</h3><p>Whether we’re working together online or in person, this is where you’ll receive your individualized training plan! Creative, functional and fun, it will build on itself regularly to maximize your results. Forget boring, templated plans - you'll get unique programming that builds on your successes to keep you moving toward your goals.</p></div>
       <div><img src="img/step3.PNG"><h3>RE-ASSESS & RE-TEST</h3><p>No boredom or plateaus here, I promise! We’ll use periodic check-ins and a handful of measurement tools to keep it exciting and keep you moving forward. Assessing and re-testing where you're at will help us measure all the ways in which your fitness is improving and make sure your program is giving you maximum value for your energy.</p></div>
       <div><img src="img/step4.PNG"><h3>ONGOING SUPPORT</h3><p>While our appointments provide you with valuable time to check-in, I will always be available within 24 hours to answer your burning questions or give advice when hiccups arise. With communication methods tailored to what works best for you, you can count on motivation and accountability all the way through.</p></div>
